In CHEMKIN folder several kinetics schemes (together with thermodynamic and transport properties) are available in CHEMKIN format. To be used in OpenFOAM they must be preprocessed using the OpenSMOKE_CHEMKINInterpreter.sh utility. The pre-processing can be performed running the Run.sh file in each folder.

In PreProcessed folder the preprocessed versions of kinetic schemes in CHEMKIN folder are available. 

Additional kinetic mechanisms can be found at the following web address in CHEMKIN format:

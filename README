Original source code retrieved from: http://creckmodeling.chem.polimi.it/openfoam.html

To use the build with OpenFOAM 1.7.x (maybe works with 1.7.0 and 1.7.1), simply run:

  git clone https://github.com/wyldckat/libOpenSMOKE.git
  cd libOpenSMOKE
  ./Allwmake

To build with OpenFOAM 2.0.x or 2.1.x or above, before running "Allwmake", check which versions exist by running:
  git branch -a

For example, if it shows "remotes/origin/v2.0.x", then run these steps:
  git checkout v2.0.x
  ./Allwmake

Notes:
  * The files on the folder "utilities/exe" are static binaries. I don't know where the original source code is.
  * On Ubuntu, install GSL by simply running:
     sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dev
  * Or if you want to build your own GSL, edit the file "Allwmake" and change the path "$HOME/gsl" to your own installation path of GSL.
     export GSL_INST_DIR="$HOME/gsl"

To use this:

  git clone https://github.com/wyldckat/libOpenSMOKE.git
  cd libOpenSMOKE
  ./Allwmake

Notes:
  * The files on the folder "utilities/exe" are static binaries. I don't know where the original source code is.
  * On Ubuntu, install GSL by simply running:
     sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dev
  * Or if you want to build your own GSL, edit the file "Allwmake" and change the path "$HOME/gsl" to your own installation path of GSL.
     export GSL_INST_DIR="$HOME/gsl"
